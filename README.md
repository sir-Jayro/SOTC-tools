# SOTC-tools
A set of tools to work with Shadow of the Colossus PS2

These tools are known to work on Windows and Linux. Mac has not been tested

These tools are still a work in progress and may not work as intended.  
There are also style inconsistencies due to age differences.  
More tools will be added as more data structures are reverse engineered.

TODO:
  * Refactor all files to have a unified style
  * Work on file TODOs
  * Setup a build system? (probably not)
